"""
When a person occupies a "block" (consecutive set of unoccupied stalls),
the block is divided into two parts, which differ in size by zero or one.

Given a number of stalls, we can draw a binary tree of the sizes of the
blocks and their consecutive dividings. As, within each level, the sizes of the
blocks can only differ by at most one, we can calculate iteratively
in logarithmic time the size of the block that the kth person will enter.
From this, we can read off the values of max {max(L_s, R_s)} and
max {min(L_s, R_s)}.

    This solution has a bug in it, somewhere... the output produced for the
    large dataset was incorrect, although the smaller ones were correct.

    From looking at the post-contest analysis, it looks like my approach
    is similar, but their loop is much simpler... perhaps the error comes from
    assuming that the largest possible block sizes always come in pairs, or
    just some rounding error somewhere. Oh well.
